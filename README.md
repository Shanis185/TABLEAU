This project is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics course. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize lightning strike counts in the United States using Tableau. The dataset contains four key columns: latitude, longitude, date, and lightning strike counts, where each row represents the total lightning strike count for a specific date and location.

The project includes creating a dynamic dashboard with two interactive worksheets and a set of filters for a detailed exploration of the data.

## Project Overview
This dashboard is designed to provide insights into lightning strike patterns across the United States by displaying the data using two bar graphs:

By Weekday: Displays lightning strike counts for each day of the week.
By Adjacent Day: Shows lightning strike counts by adjacent days (dates and months).
Key Features of the Dashboard
Two Dynamic Worksheets:
By Weekday: Divides the data by the days of the week, showing lightning strike trends for each day.
By Adjacent Day: Organizes the data by date and month for a more granular view.
Filters:
Month Filter: Allows users to filter the "By Adjacent Day" data by month.
Day of the Week Filter: Enables users to filter the "By Weekday" data by specific weekdays.
Legend: Distinguishes between holidays and non-holidays. Holidays are displayed in orange, and non-holidays are shown in blue.
Holiday Data: Holidays are clearly indicated with a contrasting color for easy differentiation.
## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project represents lightning strike counts in the United States, with the following columns:

Latitude: The latitude coordinate of the lightning strike.
Longitude: The longitude coordinate of the lightning strike.
Date: The date of the lightning strikes.
Lightning Strike Count: The total number of lightning strikes recorded on that date and at that location.
## Dashboard Design
1. By Weekday Worksheet
This worksheet visualizes lightning strike counts aggregated by days of the week. It allows users to explore which days experience higher lightning strike frequencies.

2. By Adjacent Day Worksheet
The "By Adjacent Day" worksheet displays lightning strike counts based on dates and months, providing an overview of lightning trends over time.

## Filters and Interactivity
Month Filter: Dynamically filters the "By Adjacent Day" data based on the selected month.
Day of the Week Filter: Filters the "By Weekday" data based on the selected day of the week.
Legend: The legend differentiates holidays from non-holidays, using orange for holidays and blue for non-holidays.
Holiday Highlighting
Holidays are highlighted in orange within the visualizations, making them easily distinguishable from non-holiday data, which is shown in blue.

## Tools Used
Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Cleaning: Tableauâ€™s data preparation tools were used to clean and structure the dataset for visualization.
